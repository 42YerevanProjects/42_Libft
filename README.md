# 42_Libft

My first project in 42.
Libft is a library, which includes a set of useful and basic C functions.

To use the library you need to...

1. Clone the repository with header file and Makefile
2. Run the command: make (it will prime the library and will create *.o and libft.a files)
3. Run the command: make fclean (it will delet the *.o files and libft.a file)
4. Include the library in your code ( #include "libft.h")
5. Run the C file with the following command: gcc -L. -lft <file_name.c>
